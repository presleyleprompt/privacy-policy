# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Prompt AI. This policy applies to our handling of information about site visitors, prospective customers, and customers and authorized users (in relation to their procurement of the services and management of their relationship with Prompt AI). We refer collectively to these categories of individuals as "you" throughout this policy.

# Data Prompt AI Collects
Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

## User Uploaded Content
Users may choose to upload their personal data to our service. We may use that data to improve our service.

## Identity and access
When you sign up for a Prompt AI product, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company name. We also log account access by full IP address for security and fraud prevention purposes. We’ll never sell your personal information to third parties, except as described in this policy.

## Product interactions
We store on our servers the content that you upload or receive or maintain in your Prompt AI product accounts. We keep this content as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we’ll delete the content within 60 days.

## Website interactions
We may collect information about how your device has interacted with our website for analytics and statistical purposes. Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our website, and how they interact with our product. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our service.

## Voluntary correspondence
When you email Prompt AI with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store information you may volunteer, for example, written responses to surveys. If you agree to a customer interview, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We will only do so with your express consent.

# How we approach mobile app permissions
We offer optional desktop and mobile apps for some of our products. Because of how the platforms are designed, our apps typically must request your consent before accessing contacts, calendar, camera, and other privacy-sensitive features of your device. Consent is optional, but you will not be able to use the full features of Prompt AI without access to photos or video. 

# Sharing of Information
We may share information with third party service providers that perform services on our behalf. We may disclose your information at your direction if you integrate a third-party service into your use of our products.
We avoid accessing user uploaded content, except in the following situations:
1. When required under applicable law in order to respond to legal process.
2. To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission. If at any point we need to access your content to help you with a support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.
3. To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses. 
4. As aggregated and de-identified data. We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the services. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including marketing or analytics.
   
# What happens when you delete content in your product accounts
We give you the option to remove content from your account after it has been uploaded. Anything you remove from your product accounts while they are active may remain on our active servers for 30 days, and copies of the content may be held in backups of our application databases for up to another 30 days after that.

If you choose to cancel your account, your content will become immediately inaccessible and should be purged from our systems in full within 60 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-canceled accounts. 

# Data retention
We keep your information for the time necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and your choices, after which time we may delete and/or aggregate it. We may also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Through this policy, we have provided specific retention periods for certain types of information.

# Changes and questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information?
